# HelloJFrame
First IntelliJ IDEA project "Hello World!" written in Java.
Shared with GitHub.
Adding another println() output by editing Java file in browser on GitHub and adding a README file.

Had to rename project as INelliJ IDEA is so shit you can't delete a project. It just fucks up everything you try to do.
